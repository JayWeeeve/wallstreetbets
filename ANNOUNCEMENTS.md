# Announcements

This is a log of all announcements that have been posted in the Discord #announcements channel to increase transparency to github.

## suddenclaireity#4409 02/18/2021

`@everyone` My post on reddit was just removed. That's okay. I'm not sure why and we're looking into it.

This is probably the break we needed. We have an incredible amount of support. We don't need a top-of-reddit post to make a difference. We can finish up responding to the DMs since they're agnostic of the post. From there, we'll democratize the process of how we move forward.

## suddenclaireity#4409 02/18/2021

`@everyone`

On February 18th, in the "Virtual Hearing - Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide," congressional hearing, it became evident that hedge funds have already started investing exorbitant amounts of resources into data mining and analysis on stock trends in social media.

While these organizations have a significant financial advantage over average retail investors that allow them to make more educated decisions, we the people have the manpower, the expertise, and the determination to provide this same information to everyone. We will collaboratively collect and publicly disseminate the same information that hedge funds are paying for with the goal of leveling the playing field for the average retail investor.

--

This is our vision statement. We may change and perfect the wording in the future, but the purpose and meaning behind this statement will not change. We will never accept any funds or make any deals with anyone who wants to contribute if it means contradicting these ideals in anyway.

Edit: I wanted to get this out ASAP in response to zjz's message. A more detailed response to follow.

## Auzymundius#0247 02/18/2021

`@everyone` After our conversation with zjz and seeing his response on reddit, we believe there may have been some miscommunication. We ARE NOT planning on selling out to some "angel investor" or anything. There has been one conversation that has occurred between us and said investor, and we are currently unsure what he would want out of it. It was merely intended to be mentioned in passing to illustrate the potential this idea has gathered within hours of its conception.

Anything that goes against our vision statement, goals, or ideals of leveling the playing field will NOT be tolerated. To address the "it's happening whether you help or not", that was first brought up by zjz (in different terms) and we were all in agreement. Someone, somewhere, is going to do this regardless of WSB's support. Do we want it to be us, who we know have good intentions, or the other people?

## notjoshjames#3141 02/19/2021

Hey `@everyone`, here's a quick survey for everyone to take. We'll all have a chance to learn more about each other and our ideas tomorrow. Let's get some rest and rally in the AM (just like GME).

Also, please don't hate me after....

https://mintpi.typeform.com/to/GO9srByg

## notjoshjames#3141 02/19/2021

Just letting everyone know, we're working on community guidelines and a code of conduct right now. We're going to try and build a democratic decisioning process, which will take some time. Meanwhile, please continue to make suggestions in #discord-ideas-discussion and use reactions to emphasize ideas that you'd like to see updates on. Let's also try and keep a good signal-to-noise ratio.

## suddenclaireity#4409 02/19/2021

I‚Äôd like to start by once again saying how humbled and amazed I am at the efforts that have been put forth thus far. This announcement will serve as a reminder as well as outlining what to expect.

- All people who reached out on Reddit asking to be involved have been sent a discord link. This could potentially add several hundred more people to our discord.
- A [code of conduct](CONDUCT.md) was written.
- An organization/hierarchy document for moderators and their responsibilities in this discord is in process; however, due to timezones, we're not able to finalize this just yet.

**Make sure you have filled out the introduction survey to be considered in the next steps!**

- üî∂ **One-minute Survey**  about what your visions are for this project. This is the first step in taking the ideas throughout discord and narrowing it down.
    - https://mintpi.typeform.com/to/GO9srByg

- üî∂ **Introduction Survey** answering refined questions about your skill level and intended level of involvement.
    - https://forms.gle/pyXMDFFZXempzjBW9


The following is a brief overview of the steps I will be making to take this project from a viral Reddit post into a tangible service:

- [X] Finish inviting the ~500 people from Reddit I didn't get to yesterday

- [X] Give everyone a chance to fill out the surveys on their qualifications and vision

- [X] Pick out the strongest technical leaders with the most experience and knowledge balanced with their willingness to be involved, reach out to them, and create appropriate roles for them. If there is any controversy here, we can vote on who these leaders should be to democratize this process. We will discuss the results of the vision survey as well.

- [ ] Get these SME/Tech/PM Stakeholders and reach out together to the people who have already started their own projects in this field and set up some meetings.

- [ ] Between our SMEs, we will decide what to keep as a base for our work from what exists already and what those authors are willing to share. There is no reason to reinvent the wheel if we don't have to.

- [ ] Start the repo, and decide who from this community will be allowed to approve/merge stuff in/etc. for ongoing maintenance.

- [ ] All the eager developers begin contributing, and it becomes an open source project just like anything else out there.


** Current Goals**

1) There are still over 500 people who have contacted me on Reddit who want to be involved with all sorts of valuable skills that I don‚Äôt want to miss out on. I am unfortunately still rate limited on Reddit, so I‚Äôm not able to respond directly to the ~300 chat DMs and must open up their Reddit profiles individually and send them a non-chat DM. This is time consuming, but it‚Äôs important to be done.

2) We are assembling a team of discord moderators among the people here who have experience and have volunteered their time. We are delegating responsibilities among this group to (for the time being) ‚Äúown‚Äù certain channels such that we don‚Äôt lose any valuable information, ideas, or names of people who are actively getting more involved. This is crucial before inviting more people to this discord. Technical stakeholders and owners will be decided at a later time.

3) I will be releasing more information later today regarding a code of conduct as well as guidelines for transparency. These will be provided to you to give feedback on. In the meantime, voice any concerns you have in the questions-comments-and-concerns channel.


**Address concerns that have been raised**


Regarding structure, finance, and the WSB sub-reddit, I would like to make some clarifications.

- When I initially mentioned the angel investor, I did so because I saw his enthusiasm as a testament to what potential this idea had. There were only a dozen people in the discord at the time--I had no idea how big this was going to get. After talking with the investor, I have concerns about his values. He has not been contacted since. He was never taken on, so there is no one to drop at this time.

- If we ever reach a point where we need money--for legal fees, for servers, for hosting, etc--I hope we can achieve that through ordinary crowdsourcing means, such as a kickstarter. Any "investor" would be asked to make a contribution through those means and at best, be rewarded with a public thank you the same as a large-scale donor at the zoo would get a brick with their name on it.

**Nothing will compromise the integrity of this project. It started, and will always be, fully in the hands of the people who are doing this for the people.**

- Unfortunately zjz hopped in the discord at probably the worst time he could have, because we weren't able to balance all the information we were getting yet. I'm no longer able to send him direct messages on discord. I have been banned from the sub-reddit. I have reached out to him in Reddit DMs attempting to clarify and apologize, but have not received a response. Other mods here are reaching out and we hope to clear up these miscommunications and are happy to work with WSB. Unfortunately there is nothing I can do as an individual until I receive a response to my DMs. I plan to reach out to him again once we have an MVP going.

- With regards to structure--please continue to treat this project as you would if you stumbled upon a small open source project browsing gitlab in your free time. We have no reason to need funding or donations right now. These are premature conversations and will be handled as they become relevant, and they won‚Äôt be relevant until after we have actually made progress on a product itself. This will not result in a commercial entity (at least it will not as long as I have any say in that).

- Many people have reached out to me regarding similar projects that already exist. I'm keeping an ongoing list of all of these. Once we have a basic structure here, we will reach out to the owners of existing projects and see what we can do collaboratively. Personally, I don't see any need to reinvent the wheel if we don't have to. However, we still need to identify who our technical leaders will be before moving in that direction, and that's still a few days out at least.

**Thank you for your patience as we continue to get started. This is already enormous and while that means we have a lot of long-term sustainability, it means getting started is a little bit slower.**

## suddenclaireity#4409 02/20/2021

Hey everyone! I'm going through everyone's introduction surveys and I'm realizing that I want to hop in a call with yall and come up with what all categories do we need an SME in. We have the discord categories, but I'm realizing those were kind of established on a whim just to organize the conversation. So I'd like some feedback as I categorize the people from the survey results into those categories.

I'll be hopping in a voice channel at 1pm MST tomorrow, I'd love any of yall to join to help solidify that.

## suddenclaireity#4409 02/21/2021

Thanks everyone for your help today! To recap, I wanted a new set of discord channels (and subsequently SMEs) that more accurately capture what we needed. The original discord channels were just created on a whim to handle the volume of Day 1, but needed to be more refined.  We discussed what needed to be broken down more (Natural Language Processing different than ML/DS, for example) and created a new list.

1. Testing/QA
2. Database
3. Finance (Not Accounting)
4. Devops
5. Integrations (API, SDK, etc)
6. Architecture (software design, modularization)
7. NLP
8. Security
9. Machine Learning
10. Data Science
11. Data visualization
12. Front-end/UI
13. UX
14. Analytics/Reconciliation/Data-Integrity
15. Compliance
16. Legal

For each of these categories, a new discord channel has been made. Old ones may have been aggregated/changed into this categories. Channels that do not fit these categories have been locked from further posting, and put in "archive" at the bottom so that the content can still be accessed. Continue to use #general and #ideas-discussion for general engineering discussion. **These are not necessarily final** and can be adjusted as needed to fit our needs.

----------------------------

**Regarding our next steps...**

Fortunately, there's a LOT of responses and progress is slower than I had hoped to go through the intro survey. I have to be the one alone to go through these survey results, as the survey results contain a lot of personal identifying information. My employer has made it clear that I'm good to continue with this project as long as I don't do it during work hours so that will slow me down; however, I'm hoping I can finish going through them tomorrow or tuesday

This is what the next steps will look like:

For each category listed above, I will be pulling any potential SMEs (subject matter experts) from the introduction survey results. I will reach out to these people individually, and confirm their interest in stepping up to a larger role.

:small_orange_diamond: Afterwards, I will place all potential SMEs into restricted channels that mirror the ones we just made. Everyone will be allowed to see and emoji, but only the potential-SMEs will be allowed to post. **This way, everyone can see the discussion on how the SME for each category is established.**

:small_orange_diamond: My hopes are that when we get all the smartest people in an area in a room together, it's apparent among themselves who should be the SME for that area. This makes the most sense to me because who is the most qualified to determine who our SME on NLP is other than the people who are experienced in NLP, for example? __If you feel like you should be considered as an SME and you're not, reach out to me immediately to be added to consideration.__ I'm hoping no one falls through the cracks, but hopefully this plan will rectify any mistakes I may make. This is the most fair, transparent, and equitable way I can think of to establish who our SMEs are while maintaining everyone's privacy who filled out the survey. NOTE: If an agreement can't be made, we can put it up to a vote.

:small_orange_diamond: Once these people are established, they will be made admins of discord and the git repo, and begin leading development.

:small_orange_diamond: For everyone who was qualified-but-not-quite-as-qualified-as-the-SME and who still want to step up to a more involved role, we will be discussing ways to make that happen. For now, the tentative plan will be SME moderators for the purposes of guiding discussion and working together with the SME admins, as well as your individual contributions as a developer. Who these people are will ultimately be up to the discretion of the SME admins, so continue to have meaningful conversations in the appropriate channels so our SMEs know who they want to involve further.

:small_orange_diamond: A team of discord-only moderators will be maintained separately to help exclusively with things like organizing channels, enforcing the code of conduct, etc.

A few notes:

1) Some roles may need more than one SME. Some may ultimately be a pair of people who work well together, such as a tenured professional with the right knowledge and a fresh college grad who has the spare time. This is relatively flexible

2) The only non-development SMEs we will be establishing right now will be finance, and we will certainly want many of these. We need our financial/stock market/etc. experts to make sure the development makes sense and is centered around useful data. The rest will be established as-needed.

3) If you're potentially qualified to be an SME in multiple categories, you can be put into consideration for them. However, you will have to commit to moving forward with only one, and cannot be an SME admin for multiple categories to prevent overburdening.

4) This announcement is the minute meetings from today

As always, don't hesitate to ask questions or bring up any concerns.

Thank you again!

## suddenclaireity#4409 02/22/2021

`@everyone` If you're interested in becoming a discord moderator, please fill out this survey: https://forms.gle/HpkKNaTUXywqMwAc7

Responsibilities include but are not necessarily limited to:

* Enforcing the code of conduct, including punishing members who do not follow it
* Flagging potential sensitive issues for admins
* Setting up and maintaining discord bots
* Setting up and maintaining discord channels
* Answering general questions, reminding people to check the announcements and pinned messages
* Assigning appropriate roles to members
* Assisting with writing up meeting minutes and distributing them

## suddenclaireity#4409 02/22/2021

When we first made the introduction survey, we didn't include every technical category that we ultimately decided we needed an SME for as an option in the survey. So, if you specialize in one of the following areas and want to be considered as an SME, please reach out to me:

* Integrations (API, SDK, etc)
* Data visualization
* Compliance with legal/standards/etc
* Analytics, Reconciliation, and Data Integrity
* NLP expertise specifically
* UX

Please message me with your years of experience in that field also. This will likely be the last `@everyone` tag in announcements. I am SO sorry for all the notifications, but I didn't want anyone to miss their chance to be an SME if they feel they are qualified.

## suddenclaireity#4409 02/23/2021

In the interest of transparency--

`@Auzy` had a pipe burst in his home this weekend and hasn't been able to assist me with admin tasks, and `@Jerm` has likewise had real-life obligations this week. In order to speed up the process, I have promoted `@notjoshjames` and `@michaelelgato` to help me with administrative tasks. They have been able to go through the vision survey and aggregate the data, and we will be finding a time to discuss that going forward.

People who have been putting in work as discord mods to help out so far, but who also want to apply for SME candidacy, have been removed from their moderator status to ensure the process is fair.

I am promoting new people to discord mod status to help out in the meantime :slight_smile: Please fill out the survey linked above if you are interested in contributing!

## suddenclaireity#4409 02/23/2021

Hey everyone!! I have finished going through the survey results and reached out to our potential SME candidates. If you haven't already, please check your direct messages from me and confirm your willingness to step up, and then I will be changing your role in discord.

The most common reasons people were not reached out to were:

:small_orange_diamond:  Still in undergrad or 0-2 years of experience, and did not describe personal/relevant projects
:small_orange_diamond:  Only had 0-3 hours available
:small_orange_diamond:  In general, not descriptive enough about qualifications or interest
:small_orange_diamond:  **A typo in your discord username and I wasn't able to find you**
:small_orange_diamond:  I am overwhelmed, and potentially just made a mistake
:small_orange_diamond: If you submitted your survey response after I started going through them, I probably missed it.

Additionally, please understand I was going through hundreds of people's answers and their resumes, so I could have just missed you. If you have not received a DM from me and you believe you should be considered for an SME position, __**please direct message me so we can discuss why you were not initially included and rectify the situation if appropriate!**__

You can be considered for multiple SMEs but ultimately to proceed forward with only one. When I promote you to the role, you'll be able to see the SME candidate channels, but don't say anything in them yet. Admins are compiling a list of "interview questions" and once we finalize those, we'll want you to post in each channel you're applying for with your answers to those questions.

With regards to applying for multiple areas of expertise, this is my feedback: **If you can approach the project as "I know enough to be the decision maker" then feel free to apply for it.** If you're approaching it as "I know a lot but want to learn more from this" then maybe not. **Everyone wants this to be a learning experience for them, but we don't want to disappoint the hundreds of people involved already.**

Lastly, please refer to this part of our code of conduct:

**We value many things beyond technical expertise, including collaboration, transparency, and supporting others within our community. Providing a positive experience for other community members can have a much more significant impact than simply providing the correct answer**

Your compliance with this is as important as your resume for your consideration into an SME role.

----------

We'll be posting the interview questions in ~20 hours to give people in all timezones across the world a chance to respond confirming they want to be considered for SME before posting the interview questions.

## suddenclaireity#4409 02/24/2021

Discord mods are temporarily promoted in order to implement a bot for us. They will be testing shortly, don't be alarmed if you suddenly can't post/see certain channels (ultimately you'll need to emoji the code of conduct for that).

## Toul#2156 02/24/2021

In the spirit of keeping everything public,
**Discord Changelog 2021-02-24**
+ Updated #code-of-conduct with webhook to be easier to digest for users
+ Gave all current members the Code of Conduct Accepted Role
+ Fixed permissions for channels (can be viewed but not typed in until you accept the #code-of-conduct)
+ Set server to community server, meaning we can now have designated 'Rules' channel and 'Announcement' channels :5upPog:
+ Added a Welcome Screen for new users
- Tried to implement Membership Screening, current implementation that Discord does is not very intuitive so removed it :5upD:

Note: Just admin for today to setup discord stuffs, will be back to mod tomorrow :5upComfy:

:5upLurk2: Role Assign is temporarily unavailable for upgrades, apologies for the inconvenience!

**Discord Changelog 2021-02-24 part 2**
+ Added #welcome webhook
+ Added role assign to #welcome (woooh they're back! :5upLUL:)
- Archived #getting-started and #introductions channels as #welcome replaces it
- Removed #role-assign channel
+ Probably did some other stuff I forgot about :5upCup:

## suddenclaireity#4409 02/24/2021

There have been some concerns/criticisms raised about the process I proposed for establishing SMEs. A major concern is that the end result would be that of a popularity contest rather than based on qualifications, especially if taken to a vote. Another major concern is that someone might argue their qualifications to the point of being selected for SME, but not exhibit the collaborative and supportive attitude we need for a project like this. There are also concerns about integrity and egos in terms of establishing within a potential SME group who should be the SME in the end.

Consequently, we've decided that the decision will ultimately be up to the admins rather than to the SME candidates. To keep things transparent, we are creating a rubric/scorecard to evaluate criteria for SME candidates. We will be posting the "interview" questions shortly, and the scorecards shortly after that as we finish proofreading and such.

## suddenclaireity#4409 02/25/2021

SMEs have begun posting their question answers, feel free to provide reactions as emojis and any other feedback you may have in the non-SME channel as we go along. As a community member, your input is important! Tag me or one of the other admins if you have a question you'd like us to post in a certain channel to facilitate discussion. :wink:

Discussions will end and decisions will be made at 12:00 AM (GMT +00:00) on February 28th. The reason for it being so far out is to give people across all timezones a chance for fair contribution.

## suddenclaireity#4409 02/27/2021

**UPDATE 1:**
As we now have a bot to make sure new members accept the code of conduct, you are now able to invite people to the discord server without going through a mod. For the time being, I ask that you only invite your friends/others you want to invite personally and avoid posting in public forums until we're furthe along in the project.

**UPDATE 2:**
In one hour, the Finance SME candidates will be having a discussion about where we should take this project. These people will ultimately set the requirements for the project we make. Feel free to join, although anyone who is not an SME candidate or admin will be restricted from speaking unless specifically unmuted. If you have any questions during this process, feel free to post them in the corresponding text channel.

## Jerm#0762 02/27/2021

All,

We are extending the SME selection process by another 24 hours due to the amount of applicants we have in the various SME roles. We have been diligently reviewing and deliberating on every applicant, and we want to ensure we extend the same privilege to those still in queue. We appreciate your patience and understanding.

Thanks,
-Admin Team

## notjoshjames#3141 02/28/2021

Hi everyone, we've made selections for SMEs, and we're reaching out to each of them individually to confirm their responsibilities and expectations. We'll post the confirmations once we've heard back.

Go team!

## suddenclaireity#4409 02/28/2021

We're still waiting on a couple confirmations before announcing, but I wanted to note 4 changes that were made from the original categories of SME.

1) Integrations was absorbed into Architecture/Software Design
2) Compliance was absorbed into Legal
3) Analytics/Data Integrity/Reconciliation was not selected for not enough applicants
4) We have added a new admin role that is not an SME role that we've decided to call Consultant Admin. This role is designed for anyone who has already made significant contributions to projects that overlap with what we're doing, and are willing to contribute their existing work to us and make (and keep) the work open source. This allows collaboration from these other authors without asking them to forfeit ownership of these projects.

With regards to the Consultant Admin role, `@Kev#4064`  is our first one!

He has written a couple technical guides in web scraping with Python and open sources the code. He also created https://wsbsentiment.io/ which tracks wallstreetbets ticker mentions, using NLP and some machine learning to extract sentiment. He also hosts a cryptocurreny historical data repo for back testing trading algorithm. https://gitlab.com/tuangeek/cryptocurrency-historical-data

He has agreed to open source these projects and collaborate with us pending clearing up some secrets.

## suddenclaireity#4409 03/01/2021

Hey everyone! Thank you for your patience! Here is the final list of our SMEs:

* Architecture & Software Development
